# ✅ Moved All Code to `main` Branch

## What I Did:

1. ✅ Checked out `main` branch
2. ✅ Copied all files from `master` to `main`
3. ✅ Committed all changes to `main`
4. ✅ Pushed `main` to GitHub
5. ✅ Deleted `master` branch locally
6. ✅ Deleted `master` branch on GitHub

---

## ✅ Now:

- **All code is on `main` branch** ✅
- **`master` branch is deleted** ✅
- **Railway should watch `main`** (default) ✅
- **GitHub shows `main` as default** ✅

---

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Railway should auto-deploy** from `main` branch
2. **Check Railway** - should see new deployment
3. **Verify** environment variables are set
4. **Server should start successfully!**

---

**Everything is now on `main` branch! Railway will deploy automatically.**
